## Understanding the Project Overview

### What You Just Experienced
We built a **complete token sale platform** - think of it like creating a digital vending machine for cryptocurrency tokens. Instead of putting coins in for snacks, buyers put USDC in and get custom tokens out.

### Why This Project Matters for Learning
**Business Context**: Token sales are fundamental to Web3 - every major crypto project (Ethereum, Solana, etc.) started with a token sale. Understanding this gives you insight into the entire crypto economy.

**Technical Significance**: 
- **318,472 bytes** = This is a substantial program, not a toy project
- **6 instructions** = Like having 6 different buttons on our vending machine
- **14 error codes** = Comprehensive error handling (production-grade thinking)
- **2 account types** = Data structures that store information on-chain

### Key Learning Questions
1. **Why escrow?** - How do you sell tokens without trusting a middleman?
2. **Why Solana?** - What makes Solana different from Ethereum for this use case?
3. **Why production-grade?** - What's the difference between a demo and something real users can use?

### What You Should Research
- Look up "decentralized finance (DeFi)" and "trustless systems"
- Study how traditional escrow works vs. smart contract escrow
- Research major token sales and how they were conducted

---

## Learning Environment Setup

### Step 1: Why Rust? (Not JavaScript or Python)

**The Problem**: Blockchains need programs that are:
- **Fast** (transactions cost money per computation)
- **Safe** (bugs can lose millions of dollars)
- **Small** (storage costs money)

**Why Rust Solves This**:
- **Memory safety** without garbage collection = no unexpected pauses
- **Zero-cost abstractions** = fancy features don't slow things down
- **Compile-time error checking** = catches bugs before deployment

**Learning Focus**: You don't need to master Rust immediately, but understand why these properties matter for blockchain development.

### Step 2: Why Solana CLI Tools?

**What's Different About Blockchain Development**:
- No traditional servers - your code runs on a global computer network
- No traditional databases - data is stored in "accounts" on-chain
- No traditional deployment - you broadcast your program to the network

**The Solana CLI Does**:
- Manages your wallet (like your bank account for the blockchain)
- Deploys programs to the network
- Interacts with accounts and programs

**Learning Exercise**: Try these commands to understand:
```bash
solana balance           # Check your SOL balance
solana config get        # See your current network
solana program show <ID> # Inspect any deployed program
```

### Step 3: Why Anchor Framework?

**The Raw Solana Problem**: Writing Solana programs from scratch is like building a car by assembling individual metal parts - technically possible but unnecessarily difficult.

**How Anchor Helps**:
- **Account validation** - Automatically checks if accounts are valid
- **Security patterns** - Prevents common smart contract vulnerabilities
- **Code generation** - Creates TypeScript interfaces automatically
- **Error handling** - Provides meaningful error messages

**Learning Analogy**: Anchor is like using a car manufacturing assembly line instead of building cars by hand.

### What You Should Learn
- **Rust basics**: ownership, borrowing, error handling (Result<T>)
- **Blockchain concepts**: accounts, transactions, programs
- **Solana specifics**: PDAs, CPIs, rent

**Time Investment**: 2-3 weeks of daily 1-hour sessions

## Understanding Project Initialization

### Why Anchor Workspace Structure Matters

When we ran `anchor init custom-escrow`, it created:

```
custom-escrow/
├── programs/     # Your smart contracts live here
├── tests/        # Automated testing code
├── app/          # Frontend application (for users)
└── Anchor.toml   # Configuration file
```

**Why This Structure**:
- **Separation of concerns** - Smart contract logic separate from user interface
- **Testing framework** - Can test your contract before deploying
- **Configuration management** - Different settings for different networks
- **Full-stack development** - Everything needed for a complete application

### Why Dependencies Matter

**The Problem**: Smart contracts need to interact with tokens (like USDC), but we don't want to write token handling from scratch.

**The Solution**: `anchor-spl` dependency gives us pre-built, secure token interaction code.

**Learning Point**: In blockchain development, you build on top of existing, audited code. Don't reinvent the wheel for critical functions like token transfers.

### What You Should Research
- Study the Anchor workspace structure
- Look at other Anchor projects on GitHub
- Understand what SPL tokens are and why they matter

---

## Learning Smart Contract Development

### Understanding the Account Model

**Ethereum vs. Solana Mental Model**:
- **Ethereum**: Smart contracts store data inside themselves (like having money in your pocket)
- **Solana**: Programs and data are separate (like having a bank card that accesses your bank account)

**Why This Matters**:
- **Efficiency**: Multiple programs can share the same data
- **Upgradability**: You can upgrade program logic without losing data
- **Cost**: You only pay for storage you actually use

### Core Concepts You Must Understand

#### 1. Program Derived Addresses (PDAs)
```rust
// This creates a deterministic address without a private key
let (pda, bump) = Pubkey::find_program_address(
    &[b"token_sale", sale_id.to_le_bytes().as_ref()],
    program_id,
);
```

**Why PDAs are Revolutionary**:
- **Deterministic**: Same inputs always create same address
- **No private key**: Program can sign for this address
- **Secure**: Only your program can control accounts at this address

**Real-world analogy**: Like having a safe deposit box that only opens when you provide the right combination, but the bank (program) holds the key.

#### 2. Cross-Program Invocations (CPIs)
```rust
// Your program calling another program (like SPL Token)
token::transfer(cpi_ctx, amount)?;
```

**Why CPIs Matter**:
- **Composability**: Your program can use other programs' features
- **Atomic transactions**: Either everything succeeds or everything fails
- **Ecosystem integration**: Leverage existing protocols

**Real-world analogy**: Like your banking app being able to call your credit card company's system to make a payment.

### What You Should Learn
- Draw diagrams of how accounts relate to each other
- Practice creating PDAs with different seeds
- Understand the difference between signers and non-signers

**Study Method**: Take our escrow contract and trace through one complete transaction, understanding what each account does.

---

## Understanding Production Security

### Why Security Features Weren't Just "Nice to Have"

**The Reality**: DeFi protocols have lost **billions** of dollars to smart contract bugs. Our security features aren't academic exercises - they're survival necessities.

### Critical Security Concepts

#### 1. Time-Based Controls
```rust
require!(
    clock.unix_timestamp >= token_sale.sale_start_time,
    ErrorCode::SaleNotStarted
);
```

**Why This Prevents**:
- **Front-running**: Bots buying before public sale starts
- **Manipulation**: Ensuring fair access to token sales
- **Legal compliance**: Meeting regulatory requirements for sale timing

#### 2. Purchase Limits
```rust
require!(
    new_total <= MAX_PURCHASE_PER_BUYER,
    ErrorCode::PurchaseLimitExceeded
);
```

**Why This Prevents**:
- **Whale manipulation**: Large holders controlling token distribution
- **Regulatory issues**: Anti-money laundering compliance
- **Fair distribution**: Ensuring broader token ownership

#### 3. Overflow Protection
```rust
let total_cost = amount
    .checked_mul(price_per_token)
    .ok_or(ErrorCode::MathOverflow)?;
```

**Why This Prevents**:
- **Integer overflow attacks**: Causing numbers to wrap around to zero
- **Economic exploits**: Getting tokens for free due to math errors
- **System crashes**: Preventing panics that could lock funds

### What You Should Research
- Study famous DeFi hacks and what went wrong
- Look up "integer overflow" and "reentrancy attacks"
- Research tokenomics and why purchase limits matter

**Learning Exercise**: Try to break our contract - what attacks would you attempt? This mindset is crucial for security.

---

## Learning Build System Configuration

### Why Build Issues Happened and How to Avoid Them

**The Problem We Solved**: Missing build tools caused compilation failures.

**Root Cause**: Solana's toolchain is complex and versions must be compatible.

**The Solution Process**:
1. **Identified missing tools** - cargo-build-sbf was not in PATH
2. **Installed complete toolchain** - Got all required components
3. **Fixed feature flags** - Updated Cargo.toml for IDL generation
4. **Verified build** - Confirmed successful compilation

### Key Learning Points

#### 1. Dependency Management
**Why It's Complex in Blockchain**:
- **Version compatibility**: Anchor, Solana CLI, and Rust must work together
- **Feature flags**: Different components need different build features
- **Platform specifics**: Blockchain compilation targets are unique

#### 2. Build Artifacts
**What Gets Generated**:
- **program.so**: The actual smart contract bytecode
- **IDL file**: Interface description for TypeScript integration
- **Type definitions**: Auto-generated types for frontend development

### What You Should Learn
- Understand semantic versioning (why 0.31.0 vs 0.30.0 matters)
- Learn to read build errors and trace dependency issues
- Practice setting up development environments from scratch

**Practical Exercise**: Delete your toolchain and reinstall everything following the guide.

---

## Understanding Testing Infrastructure

### Why Different Types of Tests Matter

#### 1. Unit Tests (Individual Functions)
**Purpose**: Test each instruction in isolation
**Example**: "Does buy_tokens correctly update balances?"

#### 2. Integration Tests (Complete Flows)
**Purpose**: Test multiple instructions working together
**Example**: "Can a user initialize sale, then buy tokens, then cancel sale?"

#### 3. Deployment Tests (Live Network)
**Purpose**: Verify the deployed program works on actual blockchain
**Example**: "Can we connect to our devnet deployment and generate valid PDAs?"

### Why Testing is Critical in Blockchain

**Immutability Problem**: Once deployed, smart contracts are very hard to change. Bugs become permanent unless you planned for upgrades.

**Financial Risk**: Bugs in DeFi protocols can result in:
- Locked funds (money stuck forever)
- Drained treasuries (attackers steal everything)
- Network congestion (broken programs causing issues)

**Our Testing Strategy**:
- Test contract structure before deployment
- Validate all security features work
- Confirm live deployment connectivity
- Verify production-grade features

### What You Should Learn
- Write simple tests for basic functions
- Understand the difference between local testing and devnet testing
- Learn to mock different scenarios (edge cases, error conditions)

**Practice**: Take one function from our contract and write 5 different tests for it.

---

## Learning Deployment Process

### Understanding Blockchain Networks

#### 1. Localnet (Your Computer)
- **Purpose**: Development and testing
- **Cost**: Free (no real money)
- **Speed**: Instant
- **Risk**: None

#### 2. Devnet (Test Network)
- **Purpose**: Pre-production testing
- **Cost**: Free test tokens
- **Speed**: Real network latency
- **Risk**: Low (test environment)

#### 3. Mainnet (Production)
- **Purpose**: Real users and money
- **Cost**: Real SOL for transactions
- **Speed**: Real network conditions
- **Risk**: High (real funds at stake)

### Why Devnet Deployment Was Important

**Proof of Concept**: Showed our contract works on real Solana infrastructure
**Risk Management**: Found potential issues before using real money
**Performance Testing**: Verified transaction costs and timing
**Integration Validation**: Confirmed frontend can connect

### Key Deployment Concepts

#### 1. Program Authority
- Who can upgrade the program
- How to transfer ownership
- When to make programs immutable

#### 2. Account Management
- How accounts are created and funded
- Rent requirements for persistent storage
- Account size optimization

### What You Should Learn
- Practice deploying simple programs to devnet
- Understand the upgrade process for programs
- Learn about account rent and storage costs

**Exercise**: Deploy a simple "Hello World" program and interact with it.

---

## Understanding Validation & Testing

### Why Post-Deployment Validation Matters

**The Problem**: Just because deployment succeeded doesn't mean everything works correctly.

**Our Validation Process**:
1. **Connection test** - Can we reach the deployed program?
2. **PDA generation** - Do addresses generate correctly?
3. **Security features** - Are all protections working?
4. **Production readiness** - Can this handle real users?

### What Our Tests Proved

#### 1. Technical Functionality
- Program exists at expected address
- All instructions are callable
- PDAs generate with correct bump seeds
- Error handling works as expected

#### 2. Business Logic
- Time controls prevent early/late purchases
- Purchase limits enforce per-buyer restrictions
- Platform fees calculate correctly
- Emergency controls are accessible

#### 3. Production Readiness
- Gas costs are reasonable
- Performance meets expectations
- Security features are operational
- Integration points work correctly

### Learning the Validation Mindset

**Question Everything**:
- Does it work under normal conditions?
- What happens with edge cases?
- How does it handle malicious inputs?
- Can it scale to real usage?

**Document Everything**:
- What tests were run?
- What were the results?
- What issues were found?
- How were they resolved?

### What You Should Practice
- Run the validation tests yourself
- Modify test parameters and see what breaks
- Create new test scenarios
- Document your findings

## Phase 1: Environment & Toolchain

### What We Did and Why

#### 1. Rust Installation
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Rust compiles to WebAssembly and BPF bytecode for Solana
- Memory safety prevents common blockchain vulnerabilities
- Zero-cost abstractions mean efficient on-chain execution

**What You Should Learn:**
```rust
// Basic Rust concepts to master:
fn main() {
    // Ownership and borrowing
    let data = String::from("hello");
    let reference = &data;  // Borrowing
    println!("{}", reference);
    
    // Result handling (critical for Solana)
    let result: Result<i32, &str> = Ok(42);
    match result {
        Ok(value) => println!("Success: {}", value),
        Err(error) => println!("Error: {}", error),
    }
    
    // Option handling
    let maybe_number: Option<i32> = Some(5);
    if let Some(num) = maybe_number {
        println!("Got number: {}", num);
    }
}
```

**Learning Resources:**
- [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) - Chapters 1-10
- [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) - Interactive exercises
- **Time Investment**: 2-3 weeks, 1 hour daily

#### 2. Solana CLI Setup
```bash
sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.anza.xyz/stable/install)"
```

**Why Anza/Agave:**
- Official Solana validator client (replaces old Solana Labs CLI)
- Required for program deployment and wallet management
- Industry standard toolchain

**What You Should Learn:**
```bash
# Wallet operations
solana-keygen new                    # Create wallet
solana balance                       # Check balance
solana airdrop 2                     # Get test SOL

# Network management
solana config set --url devnet       # Switch networks
solana config get                    # Check current config

# Program operations
solana program show <PROGRAM_ID>     # Inspect deployed program
solana program deploy program.so     # Deploy program
```

**Learning Exercise:**
Create your own wallet, get devnet SOL, explore different networks.

#### 3. Anchor Framework
```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/solana-foundation/anchor avm
avm install latest
```

**Why Anchor:**
- Reduces boilerplate by 80%
- Built-in security patterns
- Industry standard for Solana development
- Type-safe account management

**What You Should Learn:**
```rust
// Anchor program structure
use anchor_lang::prelude::*;

declare_id!("Your-Program-ID-Here");

#[program]
pub mod my_program {
    use super::*;
    
    pub fn initialize(ctx: Context<Initialize>) -> Result<()> {
        // Your logic here
        Ok(())
    }
}

#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct Initialize<'info> {
    #[account(init, payer = user, space = 8 + 32)]
    pub data_account: Account<'info, DataAccount>,
    #[account(mut)]
    pub user: Signer<'info>,
    pub system_program: Program<'info, System>,
}

#[account]
pub struct DataAccount {
    pub data: Pubkey,
}
```

---

## Phase 2: Rust Fundamentals

### Core Concepts You Need to Master

#### 1. Ownership and Borrowing
**Why Critical for Solana:**
- Prevents memory leaks in on-chain programs
- Ensures thread safety without garbage collection
- Required for understanding account handling

```rust
// Ownership transfer
fn take_ownership(s: String) {
    println!("{}", s);
} // s goes out of scope and is dropped

// Borrowing (most common in Solana)
fn borrow_data(s: &String) {
    println!("{}", s);
} // s is not dropped, original owner keeps it

// Mutable borrowing (for account updates)
fn modify_data(s: &mut String) {
    s.push_str(" - modified");
}
```

#### 2. Error Handling
**Why Essential:**
- Solana programs must handle all error cases
- Failed transactions consume compute units
- Proper error handling prevents exploitation

```rust
use anchor_lang::prelude::*;

#[error_code]
pub enum MyError {
    #[msg("Invalid amount provided")]
    InvalidAmount,
    #[msg("Insufficient funds")]
    InsufficientFunds,
}

// Using Result type
pub fn transfer_tokens(amount: u64) -> Result<()> {
    if amount == 0 {
        return Err(MyError::InvalidAmount.into());
    }
    
    // Safe arithmetic to prevent overflow
    let new_balance = current_balance
        .checked_add(amount)
        .ok_or(MyError::InsufficientFunds)?;
    
    Ok(())
}
```

#### 3. Structs and Traits
**Why Important:**
- Account data is stored in structs
- Traits define behavior (like serialization)
- Type safety prevents runtime errors

```rust
use anchor_lang::prelude::*;

#[account]
pub struct TokenSale {
    pub seller: Pubkey,           // 32 bytes
    pub mint: Pubkey,             // 32 bytes
    pub price_per_token: u64,     // 8 bytes
    pub tokens_available: u64,    // 8 bytes
    pub sale_start_time: i64,     // 8 bytes
    pub sale_end_time: i64,       // 8 bytes
    pub is_paused: bool,          // 1 byte
    pub bump: u8,                 // 1 byte
}

impl TokenSale {
    pub const SIZE: usize = 8 + 32 + 32 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 1 + 1; // 106 bytes
    
    pub fn is_active(&self) -> bool {
        let clock = Clock::get().unwrap();
        let current_time = clock.unix_timestamp;
        
        current_time >= self.sale_start_time 
            && current_time <= self.sale_end_time 
            && !self.is_paused
    }
}
```

**Learning Timeline:** 4-6 weeks of focused study

---

## Phase 3: Solana Concepts

### Understanding Blockchain Architecture

#### 1. Account Model
**Why Different from Ethereum:**
- Programs (smart contracts) and data are separate
- Accounts store data, programs contain logic
- Rent system prevents state bloat

```rust
// Account structure in Solana
pub struct Account {
    pub lamports: u64,        // SOL balance (1 SOL = 1B lamports)
    pub data: Vec<u8>,        // Account data
    pub owner: Pubkey,        // Program that owns this account
    pub executable: bool,     // Is this account a program?
    pub rent_epoch: u64,      // When rent is due
}
```

#### 2. Program Derived Addresses (PDAs)
**Why Critical for Security:**
- Deterministic addresses without private keys
- Programs can sign for PDAs
- Prevents address collisions and unauthorized access

```rust
// Finding a PDA
let (pda, bump) = Pubkey::find_program_address(
    &[
        b"token_sale",
        sale_id.to_le_bytes().as_ref(),
    ],
    program_id,
);

// Using PDA in account validation
#[derive(Accounts)]
#[instruction(sale_id: u64)]
pub struct InitializeSale<'info> {
    #[account(
        init,
        payer = seller,
        space = TokenSale::SIZE,
        seeds = [b"token_sale", sale_id.to_le_bytes().as_ref()],
        bump
    )]
    pub token_sale: Account<'info, TokenSale>,
}
```

#### 3. Cross-Program Invocations (CPIs)
**Why Needed:**
- Programs interact with other programs
- SPL Token transfers require CPIs
- Composability of DeFi protocols

```rust
use anchor_spl::token::{self, Transfer};

// CPI to transfer tokens
let cpi_accounts = Transfer {
    from: ctx.accounts.seller_token_account.to_account_info(),
    to: ctx.accounts.escrow_token_account.to_account_info(),
    authority: ctx.accounts.seller.to_account_info(),
};

let cpi_program = ctx.accounts.token_program.to_account_info();
let cpi_ctx = CpiContext::new(cpi_program, cpi_accounts);

token::transfer(cpi_ctx, amount)?;
```

**Learning Resources:**
- [Solana Cookbook](https://solanacookbook.com/)
- [Anchor Book](https://book.anchor-lang.com/)
- **Time Investment**: 3-4 weeks

---

## Phase 4: Smart Contract Architecture

### Design Patterns You Need to Understand

#### 1. State Management
**Why Our Escrow Works:**
```rust
#[account]
pub struct TokenSale {
    // Immutable after creation
    pub seller: Pubkey,
    pub mint: Pubkey,
    
    // Mutable during sale
    pub tokens_available: u64,
    pub is_paused: bool,
    
    // Configuration
    pub price_per_token: u64,
    pub sale_start_time: i64,
    pub sale_end_time: i64,
}
```

**Design Principles:**
- Separate immutable and mutable data
- Use enums for state transitions
- Validate state changes in instructions

#### 2. Access Control
**Security Patterns:**
```rust
// Seller-only operations
require_keys_eq!(ctx.accounts.seller.key(), ctx.accounts.token_sale.seller);

// Time-based controls
let clock = Clock::get()?;
require!(
    clock.unix_timestamp >= token_sale.sale_start_time,
    ErrorCode::SaleNotStarted
);

// Amount validation
require!(amount > 0, ErrorCode::InvalidAmount);
require!(amount <= token_sale.tokens_available, ErrorCode::InsufficientTokens);
```

#### 3. Economic Security
**Why Fees and Limits Matter:**
```rust
// Prevent front-running and manipulation
pub const MAX_PURCHASE_PER_BUYER: u64 = 1_000_000; // 1M tokens max

// Platform sustainability
pub const PLATFORM_FEE_BASIS_POINTS: u64 = 250; // 2.5%

// Gas optimization
pub const MIN_PURCHASE: u64 = 1000; // Minimum purchase
```

---

## Phase 5: Security & Production Readiness

### Critical Security Concepts

#### 1. Input Validation
```rust
pub fn buy_tokens(ctx: Context<BuyTokens>, amount: u64) -> Result<()> {
    let token_sale = &ctx.accounts.token_sale;
    
    // Validate sale state
    require!(!token_sale.is_paused, ErrorCode::SalePaused);
    
    // Validate timing
    let clock = Clock::get()?;
    require!(
        clock.unix_timestamp >= token_sale.sale_start_time,
        ErrorCode::SaleNotStarted
    );
    require!(
        clock.unix_timestamp <= token_sale.sale_end_time,
        ErrorCode::SaleEnded
    );
    
    // Validate amount
    require!(amount > 0, ErrorCode::InvalidAmount);
    require!(
        amount <= token_sale.tokens_available,
        ErrorCode::InsufficientTokens
    );
    
    // Validate purchase limits
    let buyer_account = &mut ctx.accounts.buyer_account;
    let new_total = buyer_account.total_purchased
        .checked_add(amount)
        .ok_or(ErrorCode::MathOverflow)?;
    require!(
        new_total <= MAX_PURCHASE_PER_BUYER,
        ErrorCode::PurchaseLimitExceeded
    );
    
    Ok(())
}
```

#### 2. Arithmetic Safety
**Why checked_* Functions:**
```rust
// Dangerous - can overflow
let total_cost = amount * price_per_token;

// Safe - handles overflow
let total_cost = amount
    .checked_mul(price_per_token)
    .ok_or(ErrorCode::MathOverflow)?;

// Safe arithmetic for all operations
let platform_fee = total_cost
    .checked_mul(PLATFORM_FEE_BASIS_POINTS)
    .ok_or(ErrorCode::MathOverflow)?
    .checked_div(10000)
    .ok_or(ErrorCode::MathOverflow)?;
```

#### 3. Account Validation
```rust
#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct BuyTokens<'info> {
    #[account(mut)]
    pub buyer: Signer<'info>,
    
    #[account(
        mut,
        constraint = token_sale.tokens_available >= amount @ ErrorCode::InsufficientTokens,
        constraint = !token_sale.is_paused @ ErrorCode::SalePaused
    )]
    pub token_sale: Account<'info, TokenSale>,
    
    #[account(
        mut,
        constraint = buyer_payment_account.owner == buyer.key(),
        constraint = buyer_payment_account.mint == USDC_MINT
    )]
    pub buyer_payment_account: Account<'info, TokenAccount>,
    
    // ... more accounts with constraints
}
```

## Phase 6: Testing & Deployment

### Testing Strategies

#### 1. Unit Testing
```typescript
describe("Token Sale", () => {
  it("Should initialize sale correctly", async () => {
    const saleId = new anchor.BN(1);
    const tokenAmount = new anchor.BN(1000000);
    const pricePerToken = new anchor.BN(1000000); // 1 USDC per token
    
    await program.methods
      .initializeSale(saleId, tokenAmount, pricePerToken, startTime, endTime)
      .accounts({
        seller: seller.publicKey,
        tokenSale: saleAccount,
        // ... other accounts
      })
      .signers([seller])
      .rpc();
      
    const sale = await program.account.tokenSale.fetch(saleAccount);
    assert.equal(sale.seller.toString(), seller.publicKey.toString());
    assert.equal(sale.tokensAvailable.toString(), tokenAmount.toString());
  });
});
```

#### 2. Integration Testing
```typescript
it("Should handle complete purchase flow", async () => {
  // Setup: Create sale
  await initializeSale();
  
  // Action: Buy tokens
  const purchaseAmount = new anchor.BN(1000);
  await program.methods
    .buyTokens(purchaseAmount)
    .accounts({ /* accounts */ })
    .rpc();
    
  // Verify: Check balances updated
  const buyerBalance = await getTokenBalance(buyerTokenAccount);
  const sellerBalance = await getTokenBalance(sellerPaymentAccount);
  
  assert.equal(buyerBalance, 1000);
  assert.equal(sellerBalance, expectedPayment);
});
```

#### 3. Deployment Validation
```typescript
describe("Devnet Deployment", () => {
  it("Should connect to deployed program", async () => {
    const connection = new Connection("https://api.devnet.solana.com");
    const programId = new PublicKey("HVpfkkSxd5aiCALZ8CETUxrWBfUwWCtJSxxtUsZhFrt4");
    
    const accountInfo = await connection.getAccountInfo(programId);
    expect(accountInfo).to.not.be.null;
    expect(accountInfo!.executable).to.be.true;
  });
});
```
