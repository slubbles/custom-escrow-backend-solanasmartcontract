# Token Sale Platform - Project Vision

## Overview
A decentralized token sale platform that enables creators to sell their custom SPL tokens directly to buyers through secure escrow contracts. Think of it as a "modern ICO platform" with automatic execution and buyer protection.

## Problem We're Solving
- New token creators can't easily sell tokens before DEX listings
- Traditional token sales require trust between buyer and seller
- Setting up liquidity pools is expensive for new projects
- No safe way to do price discovery for unlisted tokens

## Our Solution
An automated escrow system where:
- Sellers deposit tokens at fixed prices
- Buyers get instant delivery upon payment
- No manual approval needed from sellers
- Completely trustless and atomic swaps

## Target Users

### Primary: Token Creators
- Gaming project developers (like Snarbles with $SNRB)
- DAO founders launching governance tokens
- Creator economy platforms

### Secondary: Token Buyers
