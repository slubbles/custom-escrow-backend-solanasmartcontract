# 🚀 SOON Mainnet Deployment - Ready to Execute

## Current Status: ✅ DEPLOYMENT READY
Your escrow smart contract is **fully configured** and **ready for SOON mainnet deployment**. All technical setup is complete - you just need to bridge SOL tokens.

## 💰 Funding Required
**You need to bridge 2-3 SOL tokens** to your wallet on SOON mainnet:
- **Wallet Address**: `9yWMwzQb47KGTPKBhCkPYDUcprDBTDQgXvTsc1VTZyPE`
- **Bridge URL**: https://bridge.mainnet.soo.network/
- **Required Amount**: 2-3 SOL (covers deployment costs + buffer)

## 🌉 How to Bridge SOL Tokens

### Option 1: From Solana Mainnet
1. Go to https://bridge.mainnet.soo.network/
2. Connect your wallet (Phantom, Solflare, etc.)
3. Select "Solana" → "SOON"
4. Bridge 2-3 SOL to SOON mainnet
5. Wait for bridge confirmation (usually 5-10 minutes)

### Option 2: From Ethereum Mainnet
1. Go to https://bridge.mainnet.soo.network/
2. Connect your Ethereum wallet (MetaMask, etc.)
3. Select "Ethereum" → "SOON"
4. Bridge ETH or other tokens equivalent to 2-3 SOL
5. Wait for bridge confirmation

## 🚀 Deployment Commands (After Bridging)

Once you have SOL on SOON mainnet, run these commands:

```bash
# Quick deployment (recommended)
yarn deploy:soon:mainnet

# Manual deployment
cp configs/soon-network.toml Anchor.toml
anchor deploy --provider.cluster https://rpc.mainnet.soo.network/rpc
```

## ✅ Verify Deployment Success

After deployment:
```bash
# Check deployment status
yarn verify:soon:mainnet

# View on SOON Explorer
# Your program will appear at: https://explorer.soo.network/
```
